This is an update to the EasyNDK project created by Amir Ali Jiwani.
Cocos2d-x v3.0 introduced new classes such as cocos2d::Value and
containers such as cocos2d::Map<> and cocos2d::Vector<>. However, v3.0
also deprecated most of the classes that the original EasyNDK source
relied upon. This repo updates EasyNDK to work with these changes.

If you're curious about how the system works, please see the original
project page.

The sample Cocos2d-x project included in this repo will illustrate how
to set up the directories and get communication between your game and
the native Java/Obj-C environment up and running quickly. The project
was created with the Cocos2d-x v3.0 RC0 console. The included jansson
library has been modified to successfully build with Android.
